## Week 2: Object Oriented Programming Fundamental 

### 📅 Day 1 – Java OOPS Basics
*(Date: 26-Dec-2025)*

- Learned the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and its advantages over Procedural Programming
- Understood Class and Object concepts, object creation, and memory allocation
- Practiced using constructors, attributes, and methods with real-world examples (Student, Car, TravelDetails)
- Compared Procedural Programming vs OOP in terms of scalability, reusability, and data security
- Followed best practices for naming conventions and modular program structure

### 📅 Day 2 – Java Constructors, Instance vs Class Variables & Access Modifiers  
*(Date: 27-Dec-2025)*

- Learned how *constructors* initialize objects in Java  
- Practiced *parameterized constructors* using real-world examples  
- Understood the difference between *instance variables* and *class (static) variables*  
- Used *static methods* to handle shared data  
- Learned and applied *access modifiers* (public, protected, private)  
- Implemented *encapsulation* using getters and setters  
- Practiced *inheritance* to demonstrate access control  
- Built mini programs such as:
  - Product Inventory System  
  - Course Management System  
  - Bank Account Management  
  - Employee Records  
  - Book Library System

### 📅 Day 3 – Java Keywords (this, static, final, instanceof)
*(Date: 29-Dec-2025)*

- Learned the purpose and usage of important Java keywords

- Understood how the `this` keyword refers to the current object  
and resolves ambiguity between instance variables and parameters

- Practiced constructor chaining using `this()`

- Learned how the `static` keyword creates class-level members  
and how static variables and methods are shared across objects

- Used static blocks for initialization at class loading time

- Understood the limitations of static methods  
(no access to instance members, no method overriding)

> Learned the `final` keyword to:
- Create constants
- Prevent method overriding
- Restrict inheritance

- Practiced the `instanceof` operator for type checking  
and safe downcasting in polymorphism

- Built and practiced programs such as:

> Employee Constructor Demo  
- Student Count Tracker  
- Bank Interest Calculator  
- Utility Classes using static methods  
- Type Checking using `instanceof`

### 📘 Day 4 – Object Oriented Design Principles, Object Modelling & Relations  
**Date:** 30-Dec-2025

- Studied and practiced **object modelling and relationships**
  
### 📘 Classes vs Objects in Java
- A **Class** is a blueprint that defines properties and methods.
- An **Object** is an instance of a class with actual values.
- Classes define structure; objects represent real-world entities.
- Class metadata is stored in the **Method Area**, objects in the **Heap**.
- One class can create **multiple objects**.
### 📘 Object Relationships (Java)
- Demonstrates **Association** between Course–Teacher and Course–Students  
- Shows **Aggregation** where School manages multiple Courses  
- Objects communicate via method calls  
- Models real-world school relationships using Core Java

### 📘 Day 5 – Inheritance  
**Date:** 31-Dec-2025

- Practiced **Inheritance concepts** using real-world Java examples  
- Implemented **Single, Multilevel, Hierarchical, and Hybrid inheritance**
- Covered method overriding, polymorphism, and interfaces
- Solved scenarios like **Animal Hierarchy, Employee System, Vehicles, Banking, School Roles**
- Learned **best practices**: is-a relationship, LSP, avoiding deep hierarchies

### 📘 Day 6 - Encapsulation
**Date:** 01- Jan-2026

## 🔑 Concepts Covered
- **Encapsulation** – Private fields with getters/setters and data protection  
- **Abstraction** – Abstract classes and methods  
- **Inheritance** – Code reuse through subclassing  
- **Polymorphism** – Dynamic behavior using base class references  
- **Interfaces** – Defining contracts and multiple behaviors  
- **Clean Code Practices** – Naming conventions, readability, maintainability  

## 📂 Implemented Case Studies
1. **Employee Management System** – Salary calculation using abstract classes & interfaces  
2. **E-Commerce Platform** – Discount and tax calculation using polymorphism  
3. **Vehicle Rental System** – Rental & insurance cost handling  
4. **Banking System** – Interest calculation and loan eligibility  
5. **Library Management System** – Loan duration & reservation handling  
6. **Online Food Delivery System** – Order processing with discounts  
7. **Hospital Patient Management System** – Billing & medical records  
8. **Ride-Hailing Application** – Fare calculation based on vehicle type
