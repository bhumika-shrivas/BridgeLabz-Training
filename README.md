# 📅 Day 1 –  Stack, Queue and HashMaps
*(Date: 03-Jan-2025)*

- Learned Stack data structure and implemented operations like push, pop, peek using LIFO principle
- Practiced Queue concepts with enqueue, dequeue, and front operations following FIFO order
- Explored real-world use cases of Stack (undo/redo, expression evaluation) and Queue (task scheduling, buffering)
- Studied HashMap for key–value storage, fast lookups, insertions, and deletions
- Understood Hash Functions, hashing mechanism, and collision handling concepts
- Solved basic problems using HashMap such as frequency counting and lookup-based logic
