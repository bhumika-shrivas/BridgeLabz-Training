# 📅 Day 2 –  Stack, Queue and HashMaps
*(Date: 03-Jan-2025)*

- Learned Stack data structure and implemented operations like push, pop, peek using LIFO principle
- Practiced Queue concepts with enqueue, dequeue, and front operations following FIFO order
- Explored real-world use cases of Stack (undo/redo, expression evaluation) and Queue (task scheduling, buffering)
- Studied HashMap for key–value storage, fast lookups, insertions, and deletions
- Understood Hash Functions, hashing mechanism, and collision handling concepts
- Solved basic problems using HashMap such as frequency counting and lookup-based logic

# 📅 Day 5 –  Algorithm's Runtime Analysis and Big-O Notation
*(Date: 07-Jan-2025)*

- Compared Linear Search (O(N)) vs Binary Search (O(log N)), showing how binary search drastically reduces search time for large, sorted datasets.
- Analyzed Bubble Sort (O(N²)) vs Merge Sort & Quick Sort (O(N log N)), highlighting why quadratic algorithms fail at scale.
- Evaluated String vs StringBuilder vs StringBuffer for concatenation, demonstrating why mutable strings are essential for performance.
- Studied FileReader vs InputStreamReader for large file handling, observing better efficiency with byte-based streams.
- Compared Recursive vs Iterative Fibonacci, proving that exponential recursion is infeasible for large inputs.
- Measured lookup performance of Array, HashSet, and TreeSet, concluding HashSet as fastest and TreeSet useful when ordering is required.
