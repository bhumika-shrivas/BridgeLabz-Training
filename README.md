# 📅 Day 5 –  Algorithm's Runtime Analysis and Big-O Notation
*(Date: 07-Jan-2025)*

- Compared Linear Search (O(N)) vs Binary Search (O(log N)), showing how binary search drastically reduces search time for large, sorted datasets.
- Analyzed Bubble Sort (O(N²)) vs Merge Sort & Quick Sort (O(N log N)), highlighting why quadratic algorithms fail at scale.
- Evaluated String vs StringBuilder vs StringBuffer for concatenation, demonstrating why mutable strings are essential for performance.
- Studied FileReader vs InputStreamReader for large file handling, observing better efficiency with byte-based streams.
- Compared Recursive vs Iterative Fibonacci, proving that exponential recursion is infeasible for large inputs.
- Measured lookup performance of Array, HashSet, and TreeSet, concluding HashSet as fastest and TreeSet useful when ordering is required.
