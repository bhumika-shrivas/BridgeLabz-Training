## 📅 Day 2 – Java Collections  
*(Date: 16 January 2026)*

### Topics Covered
- Overview of the **Java Collections Framework**: purpose, structure, and hierarchy  
- Core interfaces: `List`, `Set`, `Queue`, `Deque`, and `Map`  
- Common implementations like `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `HashSet`, `TreeSet`, `PriorityQueue`, `ArrayDeque`, `HashMap`, and `TreeMap`  
- Comparison of collections based on:
  - Performance  
  - Ordering  
  - Duplication handling  
  - Thread-safety

*(Date: 19 January 2026)*

### Topics Covered
- Introduction to **Java I/O Streams** for file-based and in-memory data handling  
- Byte Streams vs Character Streams: use cases and differences  
- File handling using `FileInputStream` and `FileOutputStream`  
- Object Streams for serialization and deserialization  
- In-memory data handling with `ByteArrayInputStream` and `ByteArrayOutputStream`  
- Performance optimization using Buffered Streams  
- Reader and Writer classes for character-based I/O  

### Practical Applications
