## 📅 Week 3 – OOPS Concepts and Data Structures

### 🟢 Day 11 – Scenario-Based Core Java 
*(29-Dec-2025)*
- Shopkeeper Discount System  
- Bus Attendance System  
- Mobile Recharge System  

🔗 **Code Link:**  
👉 [Scenario Based Java Programs](https://github.com/bhumika-shrivas/BridgeLabz-Training/tree/core-java-practice/scenario-based/Day-3)

- Learned core Java keywords: `this`, `static`, `final`, `instanceof`
- Used `this` to refer to the current object and resolve variable ambiguity
- Practiced constructor chaining with `this()`
- Implemented `static` variables, methods, and static blocks
- Understood static method limitations (no instance access, no overriding)
- Applied `final` to create constants, prevent overriding, and restrict inheritance
- Used `instanceof` for type checking and safe downcasting
- Built programs like Employee Constructor Demo, Student Counter, Bank Interest Calculator, Utility Classes, and Type Checking examples

### 🟢 Day 12 – Object modelling andScenario-Based Programs
*(30-Dec-2025)*
- Temperature Logger  
- Train Reservation Queue  
- Fitness Tracker  
- Movie Ticket Booking

🔗 **Code Link:**  
👉 [Scenario Based Java Programs](https://github.com/bhumika-shrivas/BridgeLabz-Training/tree/core-java-practice/scenario-based/Day-4)

- Studied and practiced **object modelling and relationships**
  
### 📘 Classes vs Objects in Java
- A **Class** is a blueprint that defines properties and methods.
- An **Object** is an instance of a class with actual values.
- Classes define structure; objects represent real-world entities.
- Class metadata is stored in the **Method Area**, objects in the **Heap**.
- One class can create **multiple objects**.
### 📘 Object Relationships (Java)
- Demonstrates **Association** between Course–Teacher and Course–Students  
- Shows **Aggregation** where School manages multiple Courses  
- Objects communicate via method calls  
- Models real-world school relationships using Core Java
