- Evaluated String vs StringBuilder vs StringBuffer for concatenation, demonstrating why mutable strings are essential for performance.
- Studied FileReader vs InputStreamReader for large file handling, observing better efficiency with byte-based streams.
- Compared Recursive vs Iterative Fibonacci, proving that exponential recursion is infeasible for large inputs.
