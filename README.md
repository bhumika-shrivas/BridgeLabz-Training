#### 🔑 Key Concepts Applied
- Variables, literals, and primitive data types  
- User input handling using `Scanner`  
- Conditional statements (`if-else`, `switch`, ternary operator)  
- Looping constructs (`for`, `while`)  
- Control flow using `break` and `continue`  
- Arithmetic operations and basic validations
